A syntax highlighting library that uses [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for incredibly quick parsing and highlighting.

You can add this library to your project with:

```bash
cargo add --git https://github.com/noClaps/znak highlight
```

## Languages

The highlighter doesn't come with any languages configured by default. To add languages, you can get them from their respective grammar crates.
